# Client Churn
Prepared dataset, developed a machine learning model, and explained it, for a fictional situation in which I'd 
identify which of the bank's clients are going to churn in the future.

## Context
_You are a Data Scientist at Delta Bank, a company that is aiming to develop a customer experience vision.
Part of this vision, one important pillar is the customers retention. As a result, the business officers would
want to strengthen the relationship with the clients for keeping them engaged and assessing their needs
and pain points. Due to the costs involved, it is not possible to target all the clients of the company. Along
with the marketing team, the officers would like to understand why customers are leaving the bank and
find the most probable churners._

## Tasks
* Identify the most probable clients that will churn in the future – who are the customers that will leave the company?
* Identify & explain churn drivers – what are the most important factors in churn?

## Project Overview

### Data Preparation: 
* Missing value imputation
* Categorical encoding
* Discretization
* Removed duplicated, constant or quasi-constant features
* Feature transformation
* Outlier censorship
* Feature scaling

### Model Development:
* Training the machine learning model that solves our problem
* Testing different algorithms to check performance
* Testing different sets of parameters for said algorithms
* Asses the technical performance of the model

### Model Explainability:
* Interpret the model's results
* Assess feature importance and impact
